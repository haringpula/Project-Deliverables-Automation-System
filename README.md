# Project-Deliverables-Automation-System

## Getting Started

This is a project deliverables tracker. made with Java, MySQL, and JUnit. Still a work in progress.

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains these folders:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies
- `res`: the folder to maintain resources
- `test`: the folder to maintain test cases

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.

> For some editor specific settings, open `.vscode/settings.json` and update the related settings there.

## Dependency Management

The `JAVA PROJECTS` view allows you to manage your dependencies. More details can be found [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-java-dependency#manage-dependencies).
